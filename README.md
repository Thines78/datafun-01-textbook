> Guidance on how to get the textbook code up and running.

We use the book [Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science: Learning to Program with AI, Big Data and the Cloud](https://amzn.to/2KfCptN).
The authors make the source code and supporting files avaliable for download in a GitHub repo named [IntroToPython](https://github.com/pdeitel/IntroToPython).

## Getting the Code

There are many ways to get the code.

### Option 1: Download (Recommended)

1. Go to <https://github.com/pdeitel/IntroToPython>
2. Click the green Code button. 
3. Download the zip and extract it into your Documents folder.


### Option 2: Git Clone using VS Code

1. Open VS Code and clone the repo. Follow instructions at [Cloning a repository](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github#_cloning-a-repository).
1. Clone it into your Documents folder.


### Option 3: Git Clone using the Command Line

1. Open a git bash terminal on Windows or Terminal on Mac.
1. Change directory to get to your Documents folder. To learn more, see [Introduction to the command line](https://tutorials.codebar.io/command-line/introduction/tutorial.html).
1. Run the git clone command with the HTTPS info provided by the green Code button mentioned in Option 1.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/pdeitel/IntroToPython.git
```

You are encouraged to use all resources available to understand these different methods. 

## Local Machine Organization

When you finish, you'll have a new project folder under Documents (or wherever you keep course projects):

- Documents/datafun-01-getting-started
- Documents/IntroToPython

## Example Code is Separate From Projects

Interact with the code, run it, modify/break things, rerun, then fix things.
The more you explore (mess with) the code, the more you'll see how things relate.
Keep your IntroToPython practice separate from your course projects.
Other people's code is for learning. 
Your projects should show your own unique code, demonstrating what you can do.
