> Guidance on how to get the textbook code up and running.

We use the book [Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science: Learning to Program with AI, Big Data and the Cloud](https://amzn.to/2KfCptN).
The authors make the source code and supporting files avaliable for download in a GitHub repo named [IntroToPython](https://github.com/pdeitel/IntroToPython).

## Before You Start

Before getting these examples, first:

1. Purchase the [textbook](https://deitel.com/intro-to-python-for-computer-science-and-data-science/)
2. Set up a good working environment. [Follow the steps here](https://github.com/denisecase/datafun-01-getting-started).

## Getting the Code

Download and extract the zipfile from GitHub:

1. Go to <https://github.com/pdeitel/IntroToPython>
2. Click the green Code button. 
3. Download the zip and extract it into your Documents folder.

## Local Machine Organization

When you finish, you'll have a new project folder under Documents (or wherever you keep course projects):

- Documents/datafun-01-getting-started
- Documents/IntroToPython

## Example Code is Separate From Projects

Interact with the code, run it, modify/break things, rerun, then fix things.
The more you explore (mess with) the code, the more you'll see how things relate.
Keep your IntroToPython practice separate from your course projects.
Other people's code is for learning. 
Your projects should show your own unique code, demonstrating what you can do.
